This Flutter app is a simple quiz application designed to ask the user a series of questions and track their score. Here's a brief explanation of its functionality:

Overview:
Main Structure: The app has a main MyApp widget that initializes the quiz and manages the quiz state.
Questions and Answers: The quiz consists of a set of questions, each with multiple choice answers, where each answer has a score associated with it.
Navigation: The app navigates through the questions using a Quiz widget until all questions are answered. If all questions are completed, it displays a Result widget showing the total score and a corresponding message.

Features:
Scoring System: The user's score is tracked as they answer questions and is displayed at the top of the screen.
Styled UI: The app features a simple and attractive user interface with a custom app bar and clear button designs.
Score Feedback: After completing the quiz, the app displays a result message based on the score, indicating the user's quiz performance 
Restart Option: Users can reset the quiz and start over if they wish.

UI/UX:
Answer Buttons: Each answer is presented as a button, styled to fit the app's theme.
Responsive Design: The app uses padding and alignment to ensure the content is displayed properly across different screen sizes.

Technical Details:
State Management: The quiz logic is managed using the StatefulWidget _MyAppState, which tracks the current question index and total score.

Widgets:
AppBar: Displays the app title.
Quiz: Contains the question and answer options.
Answer: Represents an individual answer button.
Result: Displays the final score and a message.

Customization:
The app can be customized by changing the background image, updating the questions and answers, or modifying the visual styles for a unique look and feel.
